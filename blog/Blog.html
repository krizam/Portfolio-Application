                    <h3>Reflection of First Semester</h3>
                    <p>One of the highlights of my semester was getting to know my classmates and instructors. While I was initially nervous about taking classes, I was pleasantly surprised by how supportive and welcoming everyone was.From participating in group discussions to working on projects together, I enjoyed getting to know my peers and learning from their experiences.
                    During the semester, we covered a wide range of topics related to Python programming. From basic syntax and data types to more advanced concepts like object-oriented programming and web development, I feel like I gained a solid understanding of Python and its capabilities.I also appreciated the fact that we had the opportunity to work on several projects using Python, which helped me to develop my skills and gain practical experience.
                    In addition, I learned about batch files, Linux Ubuntu, and operating systems during my studies. Understanding the command line interface and operating systems is an important foundation for learning how to code. I also learned about number systems and their conversions, including binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal
                    Overall, I had a great semester and feel like I learned a lot. From developing my technical skills to building relationships with my peers and instructors, I feel like I have grown a lot over the past few months. While there were certainly challenges along the way, I feel like I have come away from this semester with a sense of accomplishment and a renewed passion for learning.</p>
